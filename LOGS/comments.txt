1.the data set NACA6408.csv consist of  array obtained had Ns × (2N + 6) dimensions, where Ns is the number of row-wise
 samples. The first N columns are comprised of y-coordinates of the upper surface at fixed x locations and the
 next N columns consist of y-coordinates of the lower surface at the same x locations. The last six columns consist
 of AoA, Reynold and Mach number, CL, CD and Cm values.

2. Reynold and Mach number tend to be pre-defined when choosing an airfoil. Define any recommended Reynold and
Mach number in the internet and select any AoA between 0 - 15 degrees

3.sample script to the regression model to predict CL,CD,CM values are added in Model1_ANN.py in SCRIPTS folder

4. important details about the model needed to be added in the models_log.txt

Todo
1. template for the optimization needed to be added. ✅

2. make a new log file to save the important details about the optimization algorithm to see how it is working.
ex: csv to auto write predicted CL, CM, CD (later on can be used to compair methods) ,
population selection, any other information.

3. different mutation ,crossover,selection algorithms needed to be added as functions in the respective python file. ✅
